    <p>
      An actual South African wrote this recipe. Cooking meat is akin to a
      religious practice for them. It is a ritual. Now go and convert the
      masses!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>500g, 1 inch thick cut, Grass Fed Rump Steak</li>
      <li>Olive oil</li>
      <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
      <li>A bloody hot <em>coal</em> fire</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Take the meat out of the fridge, marinade in olive oil, salt and pepper
        and let it sit for 1 hour. This allows the meat to come up to room
        temperature.
      </li>
      <li>Make a hot coal fire. Wait until all the coals are red.</li>
      <li>
        Place your hand three inches from the coals, if you instantly have to
        pull your hand away, it's go time. If you can hold your hand there for
        more than a second, it's not hot enough, either wait or add more coals.
      </li>
      <li>Place the grid over the fire, let it warm up for a few seconds.</li>
      <li>Grab your lovely meat.</li>
      <li>Place it gently on the grid over the center of the coals.</li>
      <li>
        Lift it once to stop it sticking and then leave it alone, don't fiddle.
      </li>
      <li>
        As soon as you start to see juices or blood rise to the surface (approx
        2 minutes), turn the steak.
      </li>
      <li>Repeat Step 7.</li>
      <li>
        It will be harder to see the juices rising on the seared side, so just
        time it to 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Take the steak off the fire and let it rest for 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>Serve to the heathen masses and watch them succumb to the truth.</li>
    </ol>
